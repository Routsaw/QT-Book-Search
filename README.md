# QT Book-Search
 This is a re-work of my previous program "Book-Search" that uses the QT framework, this version includes a user friendly gui.



v0.0.3:
      -Added a splash screen before it launches, the PNG file it uses is included in the directory.

v0.0.5:
      -Added a splash screen (requires the included PNG file).
      -Added login functionality
      -Added a menu bar. Only the About option is working right now.
      -Added a status bar at the bottom of the application displaying how many books are in the database.
